Rahimi 2020,Effectiveness of cathodal tDCS of the primary motor or sensory cortex in migraine: A randomized controlled trial,Reviewer 1,Derin Atalan,Complete,Intervention 1,,c-tDCS M1,,,,"- An MEG study showed aberrant functional connectivity between the sensory cortex and the frontal cortex in a group of migraine patients compared to a healthy control group [20].
- A study with MEG and finger-tapping task indicated motor cortex hyperactivity in a group of migraine patients [21].
- a-tDCS is recognized for its excitatory effect whereas the cathodal mode (c-tDCS) is almost known for its facilitative effect on the brain [40, 41]. Given the hyperactive status of a migraine brain and the following reasons, c-tDCS is expected to offer several advantages over the more customary anodal mode. First, a migraine brain has a lower cortical threshold for cortical spreading depression (CSD) [42, 43]; therefore, amplified CSD propagation velocity using a-tDCS can poten-
tially increases the probability of migraine attacks [44]. Second, a migraine brain is characterized with a lower sensory and pain threshold [45]; thus, a-tDCS can potentially lower the sensory and pain thresholds and raise the probability of migraine attacks [46]. In contrast, it has been shown that the application of c-tDCS to M1, S1, somatosensory, or dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices diminishes pain perception and increases sensory and pain thresholds [46, 47]. Third, the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in a migraine brain is clear and the activation of this gene receptor on Ad-fiber leads to the sensation of pain [48]. Congruently, applying c-tDCS to S1 decreases the pain threshold [49, 50]. Fourth, S1 and M1 are identified as a part of pain-related neuromatrix, and therefore applying c-tDCS to S1 or M1 can reduce brain hyperexcitability and lower sensory and pain thresholds [51].
- Evidence does not suggest any difference between moderate (1000 mA) and intense (2000 mA) current modulations applied by tDCS hence due to hypersensitivity/hyperresponsiveness of a migraine brain [60, 61]
- significant multivariate main effect for c-tDCS (M1-S1) on all migraine pain characteristics at posttest and 12-month follow-up. Pairwise com-
parisons indicated significant improvements in all migraine pain characteristics in both experimental groups at the posttest and follow-up (see Table 4). The comparisons did not show any significant differences between the two experimental groups (i.e., M1/S1).",Mohammad Dawood Rahimi,"School of Education and Psychology, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran",,Randomized controlled trial,Parallel group,10 weeks,,"(a) 18e60 years of age; (b) a confirmed diagnosis of migraine based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders III beta edition (ICHD-3 beta) [59], and (c) a history of migraine in the last 12 months regardless of the disorder type, i.e., without aura (MwoA) or with aura (MwA).

Rahimi 2020,Effectiveness of cathodal tDCS of the primary motor or sensory cortex in migraine: A randomized controlled trial,Reviewer 1,Derin Atalan,Complete,Intervention 1,,c-tDCS S1,,,,"- An MEG study showed aberrant functional connectivity between the sensory cortex and the frontal cortex in a group of migraine patients compared to a healthy control group [20].
- A study with MEG and finger-tapping task indicated motor cortex hyperactivity in a group of migraine patients [21].
- a-tDCS is recognized for its excitatory effect whereas the cathodal mode (c-tDCS) is almost known for its facilitative effect on the brain [40, 41]. Given the hyperactive status of a migraine brain and the following reasons, c-tDCS is expected to offer several advantages over the more customary anodal mode. First, a migraine brain has a lower cortical threshold for cortical spreading depression (CSD) [42, 43]; therefore, amplified CSD propagation velocity using a-tDCS can poten-
tially increases the probability of migraine attacks [44]. Second, a migraine brain is characterized with a lower sensory and pain threshold [45]; thus, a-tDCS can potentially lower the sensory and pain thresholds and raise the probability of migraine attacks [46]. In contrast, it has been shown that the application of c-tDCS to M1, S1, somatosensory, or dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices diminishes pain perception and increases sensory and pain thresholds [46, 47]. Third, the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in a migraine brain is clear and the activation of this gene receptor on Ad-fiber leads to the sensation of pain [48]. Congruently, applying c-tDCS to S1 decreases the pain threshold [49, 50]. Fourth, S1 and M1 are identified as a part of pain-related neuromatrix, and therefore applying c-tDCS to S1 or M1 can reduce brain hyperexcitability and lower sensory and pain thresholds [51].

This hypothesis has not yet been confirmed and not in every study undertaken so far, EM and CM were distinguished
- Laypersons who mount electrodes themselves might indeed be unable to position them correctly despite adequate training and thereby impede correct stimulation, since minor deviations of the electrode position can impact both the current path and the induced electric field (33,34) and may prevent the electric field from concentrating under the active electrode (35)

Ruff received support from the SNSF (grant no. 100019L_173248) and from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 725355, BRAINCODES)",Switzerland; Austria; Belgium,,"- tDCS can modify cortical excitability (15-18) presumably through hyperpolarization or subthreshold depolarization of neurones depending on current direction (19).
- Considering the cited findings, one may speculate that anodal tDCS is best suited for EM and cathodal stimulation for CM, as these disorders may be characterized by cortical hypo- and hyperexcitability, respectively (10-13). This hypothesis has not yet been confirmed and not in every study undertaken so far, EM and CM were distinguished
- Laypersons who mount electrodes themselves might indeed be unable to position them correctly despite adequate training and thereby impede correct stimulation, since minor deviations of the electrode position can impact both the current path and the induced electric field (33,34) and may prevent the electric field from concentrating under the active electrode (35)

Hodaj 2022,"Long-term prophylactic efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation in chronic migraine. A randomised, patient-assessor blinded, sham-controlled trial",Reviewer 1,Derin Atalan,Complete,Intervention 1,,a-tDCS,,France,,"- ONS involves a surgical implantation of electrodes and pulse generator by a specialized team, while rTMS requires costly equipment and iterative hospital sessions for the patients. Compared to these two techniques, tDCS is a low-cost, easy-to-perform and well tolerated non-invasive technique that can be implemented at home. In practice, tDCS corresponds to the delivery of a weak electric direct current to the cerebral cortex, usually performed by means of two large electrodes (anode and cathode) placed on the scalp.
- tDCS effects on brain circuitry are more complex, depending on the direction of current flow (tangential or radial) and the neuronal compartment impacted (somatodendritic axis or distal axon terminals) [29], and therefore on polarity, size, or placement of the electrodes, on the targeted cortical site or the duration of stimulation.
- the current level of evidence of the therapeutic effect of tDCS protocols in migraine remains low [19]. Most of these studies were based on short-term follow-up, small and heterogeneous populations and various stimulation protocols. Notably, only a few controlled studies have investigated the use of tDCS in patients with CM [8, 37, 38], while patients with CM and episodic migraine were mixed in other studies [39, 40].
- The anticonvulsant topiramate has been recently recommended as the first-line prophylactic treatment for CM in French guidelines [59], because of the highest level of evidence of efficacy, notably based on a large, multicenter,
controlled clinical trial. Topiramate intake resulted in a significant reduction by 11% at 3 month follow-up in the mean number of migraine attacks or migrainous headache days per month from baseline compared to placebo (-37.1% ¬± 34.8 vs -26.0% ¬± 40.8, P = 0.012).
- In the present study, a significant reduction in the monthly number of migraine attacks at 5 month follow-up in the active group versus the sham group was also found, but this reduction was of 26.4% (-31.9% ¬± 33.1
vs. -5.6% ¬± 39.4, P = 0.011). Although the sample population studied was small, our findings indicate that a-tDCS of the left motor cortex may be a prophylactic treatment for CM.
- the efficacy of a-tDCS of the left motor cortex seems to be comparable to topiramate used as first-line prophylactic treatment in CM. The efficacy of a-
tDCS observed in the present study is also comparable to that recently reported in studies considering the impact of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) or monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (mAbs).
- a prolonged treatment of 22 sessions (over 10 weeks) of monopolar cathodal tDCS of the right motor cortex (with the anode on the left arm) could also reduce the number of migraine attacks for a very long period, up to 12 months, compared to a sham protocol [40]. In contrast, a shorter protocol of 5 sessions of anodal or cathodal tDCS of the right motor cortex was ineffective to improve the long-term efficacy of an acute withdrawal protocol in patients with chronic medication overuse headache [78]. 
- A recent meta-analysis showed that treatment with tDCS repeated over several days for a period >4 weeks could be effective in reducing the intensity and duration of migraine attacks [35]. Sustained and repeated tDCS sessions can thus induce cumulative and lasting neuroplastic changes in the
cerebral cortex [79].
- Neuroimaging investigations of CM-induced brain plasticity, although sparse, have shown various types of changes, including a bihemispheric increase in the regional cerebral blood flow in the primary somatosensory cortex, which was positively correlated with headache attack frequency [80]. During migraine attacks, there are also various changes in thalamo-cortical
connectivity, notably involving the motor cortex [10]. 
- as reported in various reviews [18, 81-83], beyond a direct modulation effect on the underlying neuronal fibers running superficially in the precentral gyrus, a-tDCS of the motor cortex is also able to modulate neuronal activities in many cortical and subcortical structures distant from the site of stimulation. These structures can play an important role in the control of nociception, such as the thalamocortical pathways. Stimulation of the motor cortex can also lead to strengthening or restoring the descending inhibitory controls of nociceptive information transmission.
- A third limitation is about the understanding of the mechanisms of action of a-tDCS of the left motor cortex on the reduction of the number of migraine attacks. As mentioned above, these mechanisms remain speculative, although the long-term lasting effects argue for a plasticity-induction protocol.
- Future research: although the motor cortex appears to be a promising target, questions remain open about which hemispheric side to stimulate (left, contralateral to the dominant migraine side, or even bilateral",Hasan Hodaj,University Grenoble Alpes,,Randomized controlled trial,Parallel group,5 months,,"age between 18 and 85 years; diagnosis of CM [1]; disease duration 112 months;  88 migraine attacks in the past month; absence of improvement by at least 3 different well-conducted prophylactic treatments [41], which corresponds to a ‚Äúresistant migraine‚Äù according to a recent international consensus [42]; no change in drug treatments during the last month; no introduction of other prophylactic treatment for migraine until the end of the follow-up study","pregnant or breastfeeding women, or if they had intracranial ferromagnetic material or implanted device, a history of drug addiction, epilepsy, or neuropsychiatric comorbidities, which could interfere with

Chowdhury 2022,Efficacy and tolerability of combination treatment of topiramate and greater occipital nerve block versus topiramate monotherapy for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine: A randomized controlled trial,Reviewer 1,Derin Atalan,Complete,Intervention 1,Topiramate monotherapy,Topiramate,,India,,"- Currently only a few drugs, namely oral topiramate, onabotulinum toxin A (OBT-A) injections, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRP) receptor or ligands have evidence bases for the preventive therapy of CM
- Many CM patients do not respond to topiramate alone and need additional preventive drugs (8). However, an evidence-based combination treatment is not yet available. OBT-A and mAbs against CGRP although efficacious, are costly and beyond the reach of most of the patients in middle to low-income countries. Thus, treatment options for CM are limited.
- Greater occipital nerve block (GONB) using a local anesthetic (LA) such as lidocaine or bupivacaine has been investigated as a treatment option for CM and few RCTs have reported good short-term efficacy (9,10). Its long-term efficacy, however, lacks robust evidence (11). It is also uncertain whether the addition of steroids augments the efficacy of GONB for CM patients (11). GONB has been well-tolerated and only minor adverse events have been reported in the RCTs (12). Additionally, GONB is cheap, requires little training for administration, and has minimal potential for the drug-to-drug interactions (12). Therefore, combining GONB to topiramate treatment for CM seems to be a promising option. 
- the efficacy of GONB in rapidly decreasing headache severity (13) may be very useful for providing an interval time for topiramate to act and facilitating easy withdrawal of the offending medication in MOH.
- This study showed that the combination treatment of topiramate and GONB was superior to topiramate monotherapy for the prevention of CM at Month 3.
- Amongst the oral preventives, only topiramate has shown to be effective in CM based on two RCTs (6,7). However, many migraine patients on topiramate become non-compliant due to TEAE such as paresthesias, cognitive dysfunctions, and fatigue (19).
- Topiramate is believed to modify severeal receptor-gated and coltage-sensitive ion channels, including coltage-activated Na+ and Ca2+ channels and non-NMDA receptors resulting in inhibition of neuronal hyper-excitability. 
- Lidocaine acts by reversibly blocking sodium channels within unmyelinated C-fibers and myelinated nerve fibers. This causes blockage of depolarization within the nerve, thereby preventing the pain signal transmission.

- Many CM patients do not respond to topiramate alone and need additional preventive drugs (8). However, an evidence-based combination treatment is not yet available. OBT-A and mAbs against CGRP although efficacious, are costly and beyond the reach of most of the patients in middle to low-income countries. Thus, treatment options for CM are limited.
- Greater occipital nerve block (GONB) using a local anesthetic (LA) such as lidocaine or bupivacaine has been investigated as a treatment option for CM and few RCTs have reported good short-term efficacy (9,10). Its long-term efficacy, however, lacks robust evidence (11). It is also uncertain whether the addition of steroids augments the efficacy of GONB for CM patients (11). GONB has been well-tolerated and only minor adverse events have been reported in the RCTs (12). Additionally, GONB is cheap, requires little training for administration, and has minimal potential for the drug-to-drug interactions (12). Therefore, combining GONB to topiramate treatment for CM seems to be a promising option. 
- the efficacy of GONB in rapidly decreasing headache severity (13) may be very useful for providing an interval time for topiramate to act and facilitating easy withdrawal of the offending medication in MOH.
- This study showed that the combination treatment of topiramate and GONB was superior to topiramate monotherapy for the prevention of CM at Month 3.
- Amongst the oral preventives, only topiramate has shown to be effective in CM based on two RCTs (6,7). However, many migraine patients on topiramate become non-compliant due to TEAE such as paresthesias, cognitive dysfunctions, and fatigue (19).
- Topiramate is believed to modify severeal receptor-gated and coltage-sensitive ion channels, including coltage-activated Na+ and Ca2+ channels and non-NMDA receptors resulting in inhibition of neuronal hyper-excitability. 
- Lidocaine acts by reversibly blocking sodium channels within unmyelinated C-fibers and myelinated nerve fibers. This causes blockage of depolarization within the nerve, thereby preventing the pain signal transmission.

- Results of the previous studies demonstrated a strong association between magnesium deficiency and migraine attacks. There is evidence that magnesium plays a crucial role in regulating neurotransmitter release, platelet aggregation, release of substance P, and vasoconstriction induced by serotonin. Magnesium deficiency increases sensitivity of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors to glutamate, which has an important role in the initiation and spreading of cortical depression [14, 15]. Magnesium 
also blocks calcium channel and regulates the cerebral and peripheral vascular tone [14, 15].

Roghani 2024,Efficacy and safety of venlafaxine versus nortriptyline for the preventive treatment of migraine: A double-blind randomized clinical trial,Reviewer 1,Derin Atalan,Complete,Intervention 1,Venlafaxine,VLF,,Iran,,"- The goals of preventive therapy are to [1] reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of headaches; [2] reduce the need for and improve the efficacy of acute treatment; [3] mitigate the disability linked with migraine; and [4] enhance the overall quality of life [5,6]. 
- Migraine prophylactic medications have predominantly been developed for distinct therapeutic purposes and subsequently recognized for their efficacy in managing migraine. Although the FDA has not approved any antidepressants specifically for migraine prevention, they represent one of the initial pharmaceutical classes identified to possess prophylactic properties against migraine.
- Amitriptyline is a TCA supported by level B evidence of efficacy in migraine prevention in various treatment guidelines. Nevertheless, it is poorly tolerated by patients, and its administration is restricted when there are concerns about anticholinergic adverse effects, including in elderly patients or individuals with constipation or urinary retention.
- Nortriptyline, the active metabolite of amitriptyline, demon¬≠strates a lower incidence of adverse effects. In comparison to amitrip¬≠tyline, nortriptyline is less active at both the histamine and muscarinic receptors [12]. Moreover, it exerts a more inhibitory effect on norepi¬≠nephrine reuptake compared to serotonin reuptake, rendering it a practical option for migraine prevention in cases where amitriptyline is either not well-tolerated or contraindicated [13,14]. The better tolera¬≠bility of nortriptyline, coupled with the evidence of the efficacy of TCAs in managing neuropathic pain, are likely pivotal factors contributing to its clinical application against migraine.
- Venlafaxine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, consequently increasing the availability of active neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. May exhibit comparable efficacy to conventional treatments but with improved tolerability and fewer side effects. 
- The noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways play pivotal roles in modulating neuropathic and potentially migraine pain. Antidepressants selectively target either or both of these systems. Nevertheless, they lack FDA approval [15]. When addressing migraine prevention, TCAs and SNRIs, which enhance the activity of the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, demonstrate greater effectiveness than the SSRI class.
- Migraine is frequently associated with reduced se¬≠rotonin levels between episodes and transient elevations during attacks [24]. The majority of SNRIs exhibit significantly higher affinity for SERT than for NET.

- Migraine prophylactic medications have predominantly been developed for distinct therapeutic purposes and subsequently recognized for their efficacy in managing migraine. Although the FDA has not approved any antidepressants specifically for migraine prevention, they represent one of the initial pharmaceutical classes identified to possess prophylactic properties against migraine.
- Amitriptyline is a TCA supported by level B evidence of efficacy in migraine prevention in various treatment guidelines. Nevertheless, it is poorly tolerated by patients, and its administration is restricted when there are concerns about anticholinergic adverse effects, including in elderly patients or individuals with constipation or urinary retention.
- Nortriptyline, the active metabolite of amitriptyline, demon¬≠strates a lower incidence of adverse effects. In comparison to amitrip¬≠tyline, nortriptyline is less active at both the histamine and muscarinic receptors [12]. Moreover, it exerts a more inhibitory effect on norepi¬≠nephrine reuptake compared to serotonin reuptake, rendering it a practical option for migraine prevention in cases where amitriptyline is either not well-tolerated or contraindicated [13,14].
